# Distracted Driver Prediction
Using machine learning to predict whether a driver is distracted or not.

## Problem
According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, these accidents result in 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year. Clearly, distracted driving is leading to harmful outcomes, and we need to find a way to minimize it. Using machine learning & computer vision, we can build a system that is able to determine if a driver is distracted or not. If the driver is distracted, the system can "nudge" the driver's behavior such that they are focused on the road.
